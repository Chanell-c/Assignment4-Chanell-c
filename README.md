# Assignment4-Chanell-c



It was pretty challenging doing this assignment since I'm not fluent in Javascript. 

My goal for this webpage was to add a drop-down list containing information about several employees, but I ran into several difficulties.

 To parse the information in the JSON file I used the [Json-simple library](https://cliftonlabs.github.io/json-simple/)
 I used [mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/) to generate data for the file.
